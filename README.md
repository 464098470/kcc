# KindleComicConverter

`KindleComicConverter` is a MacOS X AppleScript droplet to convert image folders to a comic-type Mobipocket ebook to take advantage of the new Panel View mode on Amazon's Kindle.

## REQUIREMENTS
  - `kindlegen` in /usr/local/bin/  
  - [unrar](http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) and [rarfile.py](http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5373&release_id=18844) for `calibre2ebook.py` automatic CBR extracting

## USAGE
Drop a folder over the droplet, after a while you'll get a comic-type .mobi to sideload on your Kindle.  
The script takes care of calling `comic2ebook.py`, `kindlegen` and `kindlestrip.py`.

For the standalone `comic2ebook.py` script:

	python comic2ebook.py <directory> <title>

**WARNING:** at the moment the script does not perform image manipulation. Image optimization and resizing (HD Kindles want 758x1024, non-HD ones 600x800) is up to you.


## CREDITS
This script exists as a cross-platform alternative to `KindleComicParser` by **Dc5e**
(published in [this mobileread forum thread](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=192783))

This droplet relies on and includes `KindleStrip` (C) by **Paul Durrant** and released in public domain
([mobileread forum thread](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=96903))

Also, you need to have `kindlegen` v2.7 (with KF8 support) which is downloadable from Amazon website
and installed in `/usr/local/bin/`


## CHANGELOG
  - 1.00 - Initial version
  - 1.10 - Added support for CBZ/CBR files in comic2ebook.py

### TODO
  - add transparent support for CBZ/CBR archives
  - bundle a script to manipulate images (to get rid of Mangle/E-nki/whatsoever)

#### calibre2ebook.py
  - Add gracefully exit for CBR if no rarfile.py and no unrar executable are found
  - Improve error reporting
